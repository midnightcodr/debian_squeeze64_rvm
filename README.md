## Installing Ruby on Rails on Debian Squeeze (64) via rvm

I ran into all kinds of (surprised) problems while trying to install the new Ruby on Rails (Ruby current stable version 1.9.3-p286). Through some googlings and trial and error, I came up with this bash script which I hope might be helpful to you.

The script will take some time to run so feel free to get some coffee but don't go too far as the installation of ruby and rails will require you to press some keys to order to proceed.
